To compile the app.

Download source code.
You need to have a Tomcat server 8.0 on address localhost:8080
Database name is bdd_pb4 and is made with postgres. It's use "postgres" and "postgres" credentials.
Don't forget to link pache tomcat 8 libs in the installation directory of apache.

I used Java EE to launch the application.
I used java 8 but maybe you need to refresh classpath.

There is no main because the subject only ask for tests and jsp.
To launch tests, go in java resources>tests. You can launch alltest or each test separately. Each tests correspond to one functionnality asked in the subject.
To launch jsp, go in servlet>right click on Table1v1>Run as server.
